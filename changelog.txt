CHANGELOG

2.0:
   - Add HGSS support
   - Fix randomisation bug where on failure, some arrays were not properly cleaned out due to double call to a function. This may
        have resulted in seeds being thrown out as invalid, where they would actually be valid. Improves seed generation massively accross games.
1.99.2
- Fixed bug in White 2 where the 7th gym could not be beaten at all
- Fixed bug in FRLG where randomization would fail when trying to add Birth Island
- Removed a rogue warp in Emerald that was located on sea, causing softlocks and also being innaccessible
- A number of changes have been made to FRLG to fix accesible warps as well as missing warp/maps
- A number of changes have been made to Platinum to fix accessible warps as well as missing warp/maps
- Surf is now obtainable in White 2 after beating the 5th gym and going to route 6
- The warp pads in the Nimbasa stadium lobbies are no longer going to be used as one-way warps, to prevent a hardlock
- Bianca in chargestone cave is now fixed and will dissapear upon obtaining Surf
- Black 2 victory road map is no longer accessible, making 3 warp points now accessible
1.99.1
- Fixed issue in Windows builds were frlg randomization would sometime loop indefinetely

1.99.0 (The Not Quite 2.0 Update)
-Initial Fire Red and Leaf Green support(1.0 and 1.1):
    -Fly and teleport enabled everywhere
    -Warps in the elite 4 have been modified to reflect the changes from emerald

-Initial White 2 support:
    -Fly and teleport enabled everywhere
    -A number of script changes to account for post game content and story blocks:
        - In the intro sequence after bianca shows you the center, you get warped outside
        - In mistralton city, the center area of the city is surrounded by triggers, that will teleport you at a specific location and play a script. This is to prevent a game freeze.
        - After the scripted PWT tournament, you will get automaticly warped back outside.
        - In Aspertia City, until you get your starter, all warps are blocked.
        - The boat captain is made always available in Virbank city (if you can find the map hehe)
        - To prevent any possible issues, Spring Season is enforced.
        - A number of useless NPC's have been moved around to free paths. (Mostly NPC's related to post game content)
        - The main deck of the Plasma frigate is never reachable due to a lot of conflicts between versions, and story flags
    -Compatible with White 2 US only at the moment

-Fixed a handful of internal flags used during warp randomisation for Emerald
-Randomization logic has been rewritten from the ground-up. Generated seeds should now give a much cleaner output, guaranteeing better playability
-Splash image when the program launches (windows only), and an icon(all systems) ! (thank you abby :D )
